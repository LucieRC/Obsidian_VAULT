# Obsidian_VAULT
This repository contains some of my Obsidian VAULT structure. It is aimed at anyone looking for drawing inspiration from my own knowledge management techniques.
This repository is not yet synched to my VAULT, hence the content might be slightly outdated. 

Please visit the ORGANISATION/templates folder to find all my templates for my different note types. 

Feel free to reach out if you have any question regarding my organisation.
